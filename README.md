## 💡 About Me

I’m an Applied Machine Learning Engineer with a strong Data Science background, working across the full ML lifecycle: data exploration, modeling, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

My journey started in computer vision and medical imaging research, building deep learning models for CT scan segmentation. Over time, I expanded into NLP, time series forecasting, explainable AI, and Generative AI — always focused on practical, production-ready solutions.

I enjoy translating ambiguous problems into concrete ML systems, balancing model performance, system constraints, and business impact.

My core identity sits at the intersection of **Data Science + Machine Learning Engineering + Product Thinking.**

## 🌱 How I Think About ML

- Data understanding comes before modeling  
- Simple models deployed beat complex models on paper  
- ML only matters when it changes decisions  
- Tradeoffs (cost, latency, quality) are part of the job
