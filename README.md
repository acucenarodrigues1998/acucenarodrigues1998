### 💡 About Me

I’m a data scientist with a strong academic and research background, currently working with applied AI solutions in the industry.  
My journey started in computer vision and medical imaging research, where I worked on CT scan segmentation using deep learning.  
Over the years, I’ve expanded my expertise to include NLP, time series analysis, and generative AI — working with both proprietary and open-source models.

I love building and experimenting with models that turn data into powerful, actionable insights.
